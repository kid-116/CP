## Getting Started
1. Set the environment variable `$LUCY_HOME` as preferred.

## Using Lucy
- Lucy works with the following directory structure:
    ```
        .
    â”œâ”€â”€ .vscode
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cp.code-snippets*
    â”œâ”€â”€ AtCoder
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ {ARC177}
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€{A}
    â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ main
    â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ tests
    â”‚           â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ in
    â”‚           â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ {00.txt}
    â”‚           â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ {01.txt}
    â”‚           â”‚   â””â”€â”€ out
    â”‚           â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ {00.txt}
    â”‚           â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ {01.txt}
    â”‚           â””â”€â”€ main.cpp
    â”œâ”€â”€ Codeforces
    â””â”€â”€ common*
        â”œâ”€â”€ base.cpp*
        â”œâ”€â”€ structures
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ grid.cpp
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ linked_list.cpp
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ point.cpp
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tree.cpp
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ trie.cpp
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ union_find.cpp
        â””â”€â”€ text
            â”œâ”€â”€ is_subseq.cpp

    ```

Apart from the folders for contests and respective solutions and tests, a few important files to be
noted are:

- `cp.code-snippets`: File includes VSCode completion snippets. This allows a snippet in a file from
the `common` folder to be inserted into your solution using just the filename prefix.

    This file can be automatically generated by executing:

    ```
    lucy updated-snippets
    ```
